###Understanding the Android SDK

As you may have discovered by now, in order to develop for Android you'll need to download the Android SDK. 

The SDK is composed of several modular parts that can be downloaded separately at your leisure.

The actual SDK that you download is a minimal framework containing a default kit of starter parts and the ability to download additional pieces.

More particularly, the pieces are:

* The platforms.  ie. Android-8, Android-15, etc.

* The platform tools. Which revision of the tools do you want to use?
